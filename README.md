I am studing for the Exam 310-065 and the Pro Git book.
I would like to create a repo where people can download this and practice the different
topics of the exam.
I hope you enjoy it and all suggestions are welcome.

I will follow the order of the book: Sun Certified Programer for Java 6 Study Guide by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates

Examples on how to run:
./compileAndRun.sh -j chapter01/Identifiers.java
