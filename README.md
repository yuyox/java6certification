# java6certification
I am studing for the Exam 310-065 and the Pro Git book.
I would like to create a repo where people can download this and practice the different topics of the exam.

I will follow the order of the book 'Sun Certified Programer for Java 6 Study Guide' by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates

Examples on how to run:
If there is a Main file in that directory, always compile that file
./compileAndRun.sh -j chapters/chapter01/classAccessModifier/Main.java
If there is no Main file, you can compile it directly
./compileAndRun.sh -j chapters/chapter01/Identifiers.java

There are different exercises:
1- You need to fix the .java because it doesn't compile
2- You need to fix a RuntimeException
3- You need to reply to different questions

I hope you enjoy it and all suggestions are welcome.
